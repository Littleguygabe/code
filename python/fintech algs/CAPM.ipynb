    "# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with Apple Stock\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through how to build and interpret the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** using Apple's stock data. CAPM is a key financial model that helps us understand the relationship between **expected return** and **risk** in the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CAPM?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Capital Asset Pricing Model** is used to estimate the expected return of an asset based on its risk relative to the overall market. It provides a formula that relates the **expected return of an asset** to its **beta** (a measure of how much the asset's returns move with the market), the **risk-free rate**, and the **market return**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for CAPM is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Expected Return} = \\text{Risk-Free Rate} + \\beta \\times (\\text{Market Return} - \\text{Risk-Free Rate})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **Risk-Free Rate**: The return on a \"risk-free\" investment, like a government bond.\n",
    "- **Beta**: A measure of how much the stock's returns move in relation to the overall market.\n",
    "- **Market Return**: The average return of the stock market (we'll use a market index like the S&P 500).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is CAPM Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "CAPM helps investors understand:\n",
    "- **Risk vs. Return**: It shows the trade-off between the risk of an investment and the return it should provide.\n",
    "- **Stock Pricing**: Whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued based on its risk compared to the market.\n",
    "- **Portfolio Management**: CAPM is widely used in portfolio construction to assess if the expected returns justify the risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Apple's stock data** and the **market index data**.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the daily returns** for both Apple and the market.\n",
    "3. **Estimate Apple's beta** by comparing its returns to the market.\n",
    "4. Use the **CAPM formula** to predict Apple's expected return based on its beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how CAPM works and how it can be applied to real stock data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Your Data**: Create a simple DataFrame to hold the risk-free rate, market return, and Tesla's expected return.\n",
    "2. **Use Matplotlib to Create a Bar Chart**: This will visually compare the three values.\n",
    "3. **Label Your Axes**: Ensure your chart is easy to read by adding appropriate labels and a title.\n",

    "#### Example of What to Visualize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk-Free Rate**: A constant value (e.g., 1.5%).\n",
    "- **Market Return**: The average annual return of the S&P 500.\n",
