NEED to get gradient of OBV over the last 5 days
    then if gradient OBV is below a given threshold
        ie decreasing by a certain amount every day on average

    then set a buy point


For sell look at the difference between the macd and sig SigLine    
    high difference indicates peak/increasing difference
