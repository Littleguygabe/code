[[January '24]] #journal 
Today was ok, I went on a ride with aubrey, then at work it was really quiet so sophie let me go early. Dad got a car sorted for me and brought his new laptop home which meant he could start setting it up and then let me use his old one.
I did 2/3 hours of coursework today so not as much as yesterday but yesterday i had the ability to stay up late whereas today i have college tomorrow so i can't stay up super late.
