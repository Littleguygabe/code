What the fuck is life. Why the am I comfortable with today. Its been a shit day, I've done fuck all. everything is so meaningless I'm living life on auto pilot so what if i work hard, why do i work hard because in the end it means nothing. I forever feel like shit, I don't give a flying fuck about most of the people I talk to, I just talk to them to pass time. Its like scrolling social media, I do it because I'm bored, because others are doing but like social media 90% of it wasting time, just living to make it to the next day, not for this day. Only I can't just delete people like i can delete social media.
