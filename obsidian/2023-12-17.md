#journal [[December '23]]
I'm not sure how how to feel about today, it's been good but it also hasn't been great. Bit of a weird one, I'm still not sure if me and lola are going downhill because we've barely talked so I'll see how it goes tomorrow at college because she mentioned me staying over to watch game of thrones but i don't think that's happening anymore which is a bit annoying. It's been a fairly mid day just tootling along doing my thing bit of coding, bit of youtube not much else to say to be honest.
