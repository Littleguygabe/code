#journal [[November '23]]
went on my phone for 2 hours this morning once i had woken up, then did the dirty - today is going to be a negative in the habit tracker - then once i was up archie called me to see if i could help with his code - I couldn't - then we ended up playing some hypixel just as a bit of a joke not seriously then i went on a ride, went down sheep track and the track behind drew and cheryl's then once i got back i watched youtube and then had dinner. After dinner i was thinking of messaging lola asking if she wanted to play some roblox. Just as i was about to message her she messaged me asking if i wanted to play some roblox which was pretty funny. Since then we've just played roblox all evening.
