1. loss of [[consumer sovereignty]] and [[consumer surplus]] which may lead to less choice and higher prices for consumers
2. higher prices - generally higher than [[Economics/marginal cost]] - no [[Allocatively efficient]]
3. Less choice for consumers
4. unlikely to operate at the lowest point of the [[average cost]] curve - no [[Productively efficient]] - occurs due to [[x inefficiency]]
5. potential for [[diseconomies of scale]]
6. [[x inefficiency]] - reduced [[incentive]] to cut costs due to lack of competition
7. reduced [[incentive]] to innovate and invest - which may lead to a fall in the quality of choice of products
8. [[supernormal profit]] earned which may not be re-invested so no benefit to the consumer
9. [[monopsony power]] - May have significant power over the [[market]] so will not look to max benefit to consumers
