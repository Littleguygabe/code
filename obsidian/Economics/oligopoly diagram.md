the [[kinked demand curve]] is following the [[oligopoly assumptions]] if a firm increases price then the good becomes [[price elastic]] as consumers purchase from other firms
if a firm decreases price then the good is [[price inelastic]] as all the other firms decrease price as well 
This is what results in the [[marginal revenue]] curves

So long as a firm's [[Economics/marginal cost]] curve is between the 2 [[marginal revenue]] curves then the firm will profit max

works off the [[kinked demand curve assumptions]]
