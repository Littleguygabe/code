 **Evaluate with the use of a diagram the effectiveness of the use of monetary policy in Nigeria to stabilise the Naira**

**15 marks**

## Notes from the specimen material
Highly volatile prices
very large number of imports
specialised in imports
WPIDEC
fully floating
Decrease in market confidence
lack of export trade levels
quantitative tightening from kenya - 1.5bn in bonds released whilst hiking up interest rates
High tax to counteract the value of the naira - tax on foreign employees
Lack of FDI



## Intro
### Definitions
Monetary Policy
Monetary transmission mechanism
floating exchange rate

Explain about how the monetary policy transmission mechanism comes in lots of different forms 
How Nigeria employed expansionary fiscal policy increasing interest rates to 22.75%

## Para 1

### Point
Stabilisation of the economy can be achieved through the use of monetary policy as the quantity theory of money suggests that controlling the money supply is key to controlling inflation within an economy which will stabilise the market

### Cause
Why is monetary policy key to economic stability?

Monetary policy controls the supply of money in the economy
Interest rate increases
contractionary monetary policy
So more profitable to increase the store rather than spend
monetary liquid demand preference shifts towards illiquidable assets
this decreases spending in the market
reduces demand pull inflationary pressure
therefore improving the purchase power parity of the currency
therefore incentivising investment 
therefore gradually increasing both long run aggregate supply and demand
resulting in stable economic growth

### Consequence
Answer the question
It is effective 
contractionary monetary policy reduced the money supply
therefore increasing the price stability

### Diagram
Monetary Supply diagram
Interest rate increase so MS decreases to control interest rate
shown in source material as well

### Evaluate
Any assumptions made

That there are no factors other than the central bank controlling the money supply of an economy
in reality there are leakages and injections that can make it hard to accurately control the total money supply within an economy

## Para 2
### Point
Monetary policy may be ineffective within the economy as other factors such as inflation rate may have greater effect on the economy

### Cause
As inflation in Nigeria increases 
value of ER decreases - source material
Cost of imports increases
The level imported inflation increases
Domestic average price level increases
So the economy is destabilised 

### Consequence
Monetary Policy can only control money supply 
So import prices cannot be controlled
therefore imported inflation cannot be controlled
therefore the inflation of the economy can effectively controlled by monetary policy
therefore monetary policy is ineffective at stabilising the economy

### Evidence
source material

Interest rate has increased but so has inflation showing that there are other factors controlling inflation rate
shows contractionary monetary policy has been ineffective at stabilising
shows monetary policy is ineffective

### Evaluate
Assumed that the demand for imports and exports is inelastic - marshal lerner condition
if elastic imports wud decrease
so imported inflation would not rise as domestic firms increase productivity to close the output gap
so less external factors would control inflation
therefore monetary policy would be effective.
