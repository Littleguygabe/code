How much labour will a [[monopsony]] employ at a given wage
Similar to a firm operating in a perfectly competitive market, the [[marginal revenue product]] of labour falls as more labour is employed

Monoposonists are not wage takers, they can influence the wages paid, if they wish to attract more labour the will have to increase [[wage rate]]. Thus the [[average cost]] of labour, so [[total cost of labour]] and quantity employed increases

As well as paying the higher wage to attract new employees they must increase the pay for current employees so they don't leave, which therefore increases the price
