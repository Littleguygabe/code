### intro 
What is a retail bank - a bank that provides banking services to households and small firms on a small scale through high volume low value credit 

what is a central bank - a bank that overseas a countries monetary policy and currency issuance

what does it mean when a bank fails - when the bank is unable to meet its financial obligations to its creditors and debtors - ie pay consumers the money in their account in liquid cash - can be caused by very low liquidity ratio due to fractal banking

### Para 1
#### Point
Yes as it can reinforce economic integrity and help consumers in the long run

#### Cause
Why should a central bank allow a retail bank to fail?

When a bank knows a central bank will bail it out the bank will take higher risks
this increases the moral hazard that banks are willing to forego
banks will lend to riskier clients - those who are less likely to pay back in

#### Consequence
So a central bank shouldn't bail retail banks out
as once bailed out retail banks are provided with the idea they are 'too big to fail' and have constant access to central bank liquidity
therefore they will maintain old practices 
which can result in the bank failing again as no action has been taken in response to the last time the bank failed
therefore creating a cycle of banks failing

#### Diagram / Evidence
2008 financial crash - the BoE bailed out black rock meaning that the crash had minimal effect on the company
this created false confidence for the financial sector and for consumers

#### Evaluate
However as a result of the financial crash UK banks now have to hold a minimum liquidity coverage ratio of 100% of liquid asset value for net outflows over a 30-day stress period
therefore although banks were bailed out it has still result in more regulated low risk financial sector regulations.
