The minimum [[remuneration]] required to maintain a factor of labour

wage required for an individual to stay at their current job

can show the number of people that will leave an industry if the wage rate drops

somewhat like opportunity cost, a figure that represents the minimum value that a factor of production must be provided before it leaves and switches to another source
**For example**:
	if someone is working a job that earns them $60,000 and the next job option they have earns $40,000 then if their initial wage is cut below $40,00 they will switch industries to their next job option.
	Therefore $40,000 represents their transfer earnings

this can be shown on the [[market labour supply diagram]] as the area under the supply curve of labour
	the integral of the labour supply curve between 0 and the current point of equilibrium

### elasticity
directly proportional with [[wage elasticity of labour supply]]

**more** elastic [[wage elasticity of labour supply]] = **more** transfer earnings

### Inelastic
the more wage inelastic the higher the proportion of total earnings will be made up of economic rent
The more inelastic the more skill is needed for the job
	lawyer
perfectly inelastic = total earnings is made completely of economic rent
### Elastic 
the more wage elastic the higher the proportion of total earnings will be made up of transfer earnings
The more elastic the less skill is needed for the job

perfectly elastic = total earnings is made completely of transfer earnings
