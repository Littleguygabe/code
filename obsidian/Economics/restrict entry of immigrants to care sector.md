the minimum wage made has increased to 39,000 for immigrant workers to be able to come and work within the care worker industry

the number of migrant workers will therefore decrease
therefore the number of care workers will decrease
therefore the supply of labour will decrease
therefore on the [[labour market diagram]] the supply curve will shift left
therefore the quantity of labour will decrease 
therefore wage rate increases
therefore supply extends as care workers within the UK will move into the industry
however as wage rate is increasing the demand will contract 
therefore as wage rate is increasing care homes will either reduce the size of the workforce, the number of patients in the home or they will go bust
