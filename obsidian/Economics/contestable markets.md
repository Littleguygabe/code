A market in which the existing firm makes only [[normal profit]], as it cannot set a price higher than [[average cost]] without attracting new firms into the market, due to the absence of [[barriers to entry]] and [[sunk costs]]

ie the threat of competition controls the existing firms' behaviour - somewhat like an [[oligopoly]]

### Random notes
- the environment that can lead into perfect competition
- the important factor is the ease of access to enter or exit not the number of firms
- Any form of market structure can be a contestable market 
	- Although [[monopoly]] has high barriers to entry they may be low enough to still have threat of new firms entering
		- Taxi market - high barriers to entry however there was risk of new firms entering
			- eventually seen by uber and lyft
### characteristics:
- low [[barriers to entry]] / no [[barriers to entry]] in a perfectly contestable market
- large pool of potential entrants
- no [[comparative disadvantage]] compared to any new firm entering the market
- good (perfect info in perfectly contestable market) information to entering firms - knowledge of market conditions
- Incumbent firms subject to [[hit and run entry]]

### Main driver of increasing contestability
Improvement in technology 

#### Why
- reduces [[barriers to entry]] as firms do not need to by physical
	so start up costs are reduced - in turn reducing [[sunk costs]]
- less labour is needed as a [[factors of production]] - not as many regulations need to be met
- reduces [[advertising]] costs so marketing costs reduced
	reduction in brand loyalty
	[[price elasticity of demand]] becomes more elastic
	market becomes more dynamic
- Increased the pool of potential entrants
	Allow for start ups to disrupt the current market through innovation
- Information has improved 
	Plays to one of the characteristics
### [[Productively efficient]]
the lowest point of the [[average cost curve]] intersects  where [[Economics/marginal cost]] = [[average cost]]


a firm can defend a contestable market by setting price at the lowest point on their [[average cost curve]] and move it as far down the [[Economics/marginal cost]] curve as possible.
	this reduces [[x inefficiency]]

want homogenous products
### advantages:
Receives benefit as if there is high competition 
- becomes [[statically efficient]]
	- [[Allocatively efficient]]
	- [[Productively efficient]]
	- minimises [[x inefficiency]]
- Job creation
	- Higher quantity production
	- Derived demand for labour will increase
### disadvantages:
- governments may think regulation is not needed because the market will be seen as being [[Productively efficient]] and [[Allocatively efficient]] - may not be the case though if there are [[sunk costs]]
- Lack of [[Dynamic efficiency]] 
	- Lower [[supernormal profit]] resulting in a lack of progress over time - **can be argued either way**
		- However new firms entering with new ideas could be seen as the benefits of dynamic efficiency 
- Cost cutting in dangerous areas
	- Reducing costs in areas such as health and safety and product quality to reduce [[x inefficiency]]
- Creative destruction - **Goes against job creation**
	- New firms enter the market
	- the new creativity and innovation results in contraction of existing firms
	- could result in job loss
	- **Evaluation** - new firms entering may be large therefore counteracting effects of creative destruction
- Anti - competitive strategies may occur
	- **Short run VS long run**
	- in the short run the market may be sustainable 
	- In long run strategies can be used to reduce contestability
		- [[Flooding the market]]
		- Mergers
		- [[limit pricing]]
		- [[predatory pricing]]

### What diagram is used for a contestable market?
[[monopoly diagram]]

#### Diagram positions
With strong threat of entry monopoly operates where AC = AR
	This the [[normal profit]] position (limit price)

#### Why market position?
1. [[supernormal profit]] is minimised 
	De-[[incentive]] for firms from entering the market as less profit will be made
	so reduces the risk of [[hit and run entry]] into the market
2. Quantity produced is maximised
	Allows preparation for if the firm actually enters the market
	1. Existing firm will be able to compete with lower prices and higher quantities
	2. Also boosts market share as this is sales capacity maximising position 
This is the extreme position of the market - typically only needs to see movement towards being [[Allocatively efficient]] to deter new entrants

### Evaluative Points
1. Length of contestability
	How long is the market contestable for?
		- If new firms entering the market can patent/copyright their goods and services then the market will not remain contestable
		- If anti-competitive strategies are being used the market will not remain contestable over time
2. Role of technology
	Can improve the ability of firms to collect data on consumers
		This can lead to a greater levels of [[first degree price discrimination]] and [[third degree price discrimination]]
		will not be [[statically efficient]]
3. [[Regulation]]
	can minimise the issues of cost cutting and anti-competitive strategies

	If it doesn't exist can argue that there is a role for [[regulation]] within the market
