## Intro
### Define
+ve consumption externality
public goods and private goods

## Para 1
### Point
No it should not as a free market tends to under consume positive consumption externalities 

### Cause
why shouldn't it
Education carries +ve consumption externalities
The cost/benefit is intangible
so shadowing pricing is used to apply a monetary value
+ve consumption externalities typically are under valued when left to the free market

### Consequence
So provision of education should not be left to market forces as it will be under valued
therefore consumers will not consume the optimal amount
results in societal dead weight loss 
therefore the market is not allocatively efficient
market failure will occur if the government doesn't intervene

### Diagram
Positive consumption externality
showing the under consumption by deadweight loss

### Evaluate
depends upon the accuracy of shadowing pricing within the economy
accurate and consumer's will value the service so no under consumption

## Para 2
### Point
Yes it should be as the free market can help promote competition and efficiency within the production/service providing process

### Cause
why should it be allowed
In a market with none/minimal intervention there are small barriers to entry and exit
firms can easily enter and exit the market
competition is promoted 

### Consequence
Beneficial to consumer as firms will operate at sales maxing to gain market share
aim to have low AC and high quality
therefore efficient use of cell
allocatively efficient
therefore maximising consumer surplus and reducing dead weight/societal loss
provision of education should be left to market forces as in the long run it will benefit consumers

### Diagram
Monopoly sales volume maxing

### Evaluate
In short run may result in natural monopolies as high fixed costs of starting a school
result in consumer exploitation as monopoly aims to profit maximise
so may be damaging in the short run
