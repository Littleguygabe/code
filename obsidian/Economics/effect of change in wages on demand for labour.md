1. If the wage paid to labour by the firm producing birthday cakes is $160 a per day. With the aid of a diagram show the impact on employment if the firm faces an increase in the daily wage of $80 a day?

	As the wage rate has increased by $80 the new wage rate becomes $240 therefore the cost to the firm increases therefore at their current point they are making a loss because by employing 6 people they make a [[marginal revenue product]] of 160 so it covers the cost of the wage. So as wage increase the firm will need to reduce the amount of units of labour they employ until [[marginal revenue product]] is either greater than or equal to the wage. This occurs when the MRP is $240 therefore the number of units of labour employed will be 5 therefore as price increases by $80 the firm will decrease the number of units of labour employed from 6 to 5 and therefore reach a new equilibrium.

	so if wage rates increase there will be a degree of unemployment within the market

2. If the wage paid to labour by the firm producing birthday cakes is $320 per. With the aid of a diagram show the impact on employment if the firm faces a decrease in the daily wage of $80 a day.

	When wage is $320 equilibrium is found when marginal revenue product is equal to $320 therefore the firm employs 4 units of labour. So when the daily wage decreases by $80 the firm only has to make a MRP of $240 therefore to maximise their profit they increase the number of units of labour employed to 5 therefore MRP falls to $240 which is still equal to the new daily wage. This therefore demonstrates how the decrease in daily wage will cause the firm to employ more units of labour as it will allow them to increase the amount of revenue and profit made.
