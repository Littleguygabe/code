**Some top UK executives are paid more than 1000 times the average wage paid to workers in their firms**
**Evaluate using an appropriate diagram(s) whether a maximum wage should be imposed on the executive pay in the UK** [25 Marks]

Intro 
What is inequality
How does a max wage work

## Para 1
### Diagram
![[Pasted image 20231204100853.png]]
But with price ceiling set below the equib level
wage max set below equib
as earnings are reduced
incentive to work for those who will experience wage cut is reduced
those on high wage typically have the highest [[marginal physical product]] and [[marginal revenue product]]
so most productive workers will have less incentive
put less effort into jobs as reward is not as large
start to make mistakes due to lack of focus
inefficiency increases
average cost increases
price in turn increases 
Spending in the economy decreases
therefore damaging the economy

However depends upon the size of the pay cut
if not large
incentive to work not reduced enough to make a difference

## Para 2 
agree as it helps to create equality within the economy

### Diagram
gini coefficient graph

Max pay is reduced
Therefore means the median wage earnt is closer to the mean wage earnt
Therefore income is more equally distributed within the economy
this improves employer-employee relationship
therefore increasing satisfaction within the work place
therefore increasing efficiency within a firm
therefore increasing total economic efficiency 
so resources are allocated and used more efficiently resulting in overall benefit the wider economy 

depends upon the govs ability to implement max wage
if not done properly it can create further civil un-rest as low wage workers still don't believe it is fair
creates inefficiency and instability so damages the economy on the whole

## Para 3
how it effects tax revenue for the government
