Explain why premier league footballers are paid more than care workers.

For footballers all their earnings are economic rent as the supply schedule is perfectly inelastic this is because they get paid so much and are on a contract then there is no scenario in which they will swap industries 

The [[marginal revenue product]] of a professional footballer depends on how much additional revenue a club can make from signing a player
	More successful teams have greater revenue streams and can attract better players
	More successful teams can charge higher ticket prices **therefore** [[marginal revenue product]] for each player is higher
	More successful teams have higher attendance
	Sponsorship and television revenues are higher
	A player's image value can also affect their wage dur to their off-field marketing value
