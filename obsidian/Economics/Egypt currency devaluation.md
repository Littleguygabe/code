**In January 2023 the Egyptian central bank devalued the Egyptian dollar for the 3rd time resulting in a loss in value of 40%.**
**Evaluate whether a devaluation in currency will always improve the balance of payments
[25 marks]**

## Intro
- Why a country may want to devalue its currency
- How it may affect the balance of trade - marshal lerner condition
- Define devaluation - purposeful managed depreciation of currency by the central bank

## Para 1
**Arguing In favour of**
Decrease the interest rate
therefore the demand for the currency decreases
therefore foreign banks sell their currency reserves
therefore the market is flooded with Egyptian dollars therefore increasing supply
therefore value decreases
therefore exports become cheaper whilst imports become more expensive
therefore incentivising domestic firms to increase productivity to counteract the drop in imports
this further provides capacity to export 
therefore improving balance of trade as imports decrease but exports increase

Only effective in the short-run as in the long run domestic markets will find other cheaper imports therefore imports will begin to increase
therefore reducing the trade balance potentially back to its original value

## Para 2
**Arguing against**
Egypt is highly import reliant for necessary goods and services - such as wheat
In 2021 they had an import value that equated to >20% of GDP
therefore the demand for imports will be inelastic as food is a necessity
therefore as the value of the currency decreases due to the marshal lerner condition as total demand elasticity for imports and exports <1 there will be no effect on the of imports 
Therefore as imports stay the same but the currency has depreciated the average price level increases in the economy
this cause cost-push inflation
therefore potentially pushing the economy into recession
therefore increasing unemployment
therefore the productive output decreases 
this further decreases the economies ability to produce exportable goods and services
therefore damaging the balance of trade

**However**
If the economy goes into recession the value of the currency decreases to such a large extent it may be able to overcome the elasticity
furthermore this assumes price is the main determinant of elasticity however as the unemployment rate increases in certain industries this provides firms that export increased labour capacity therefore increasing the productivity for exportable goods
therefore increasing international competitiveness 
therefore increasing the demand for Egyptian exports

## Para 3
**Arguing in favour of**
In the long run demand for imports and exports is elastic
This is because in the long run new contracts can be created
As the Egyptian dollar devalues the price of exports decreases
therefore the economy becomes more internationally competitive 
So although in the short-run not much may change in the long run countries will switch to importing Egyptian goods and services
Furthermore in the long run the domestic market can find alternative imports that are cheaper and the domestic market can change to cover the increased demand due to not being able to import as much
therefore in the long run the domestic market will grow as well as the balance of trade being improves.
