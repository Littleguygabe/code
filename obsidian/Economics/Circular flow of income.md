The circular flow of income or circular flow is a model of the economy in which the major exchanges are represented as flows of money, goods and services, etc. between economic agents.

There are injections:
	[[government expenditure]]
	[[exports]]
	[[investment]] by firms 

and leakages:
	[[saving]]
	[[taxes]]
	[[imports]]

when [[interest rates]] increase leakages increase whilst injections decrease because consumers gain more utility from saving their money and then it also costs  firms more to take out a loan to invest
