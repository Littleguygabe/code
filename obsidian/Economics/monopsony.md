Single buyer of a factor of production which can exploit it's [[monopoly]] position to pay prices which are than in a [[perfect competition]] market

	Network rail
		- the only buyer of track maintenance services
### [[Economics/marginal cost]]
Calculated by the change in total cost from the additional worker employed

### [[profit maximise]]
The firm will employ labour up to the point where [[marginal revenue product]] = [[Economics/marginal cost]]

The surplus profit made is calculated as the difference between [[wage rate]] paid and the [[Economics/marginal cost]]

They are not wage takers, they can influence the [[wage rate]]
 - If they wish to attract more labour they will increase the [[wage rate]]
	 - Therefore the average cost of labour, total cost/ quantity employed increases
	 - As well as paying higher [[wage rate]] to attract more labour they will have to also increase pay to current labour
