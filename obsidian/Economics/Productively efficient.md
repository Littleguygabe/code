Productive efficiency is when a firm is making use of all of its resources in the most efficient way possible

This occurs when the firm operates at the lowest point along the [[average cost curve]],
which is where the [[Economics/marginal cost]] curve will intersect the [[average cost curve]] on a [[monopoly diagram]]
