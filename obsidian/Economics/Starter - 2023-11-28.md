what are the economic impacts of the aviation industry shifting to use biofuel rather than typical aviation fuel?

### impact on demand
as the price of the fuel will increase in the short-run the burden of the increased cost will be passed onto the consumers. Therefore depending upon the [[price elasticity of demand]] of the aviation industry will largely dictate how the aviation industry will have to respond.

The [[price elasticity of demand]] will vary depending on the consumer, this is because for recreational use such as going on a holiday abroad the [[price elasticity of demand]] will be elastic however for other consumers such as those flying for business an airplane ticket may be inelastic as they need it to be able to get to certain parts of the world in a short time span which other methods of travel may not be able to supply. Therefore when talking about [[income elasticity of demand]] for the recreational user it will be highly elastic as they can choose to take a holiday that they don't have to travel so far for therefore flying would be a [[superior good]] to them whereas for someone travelling for business it is a [[normal good]]
