excess supply - an increase in the unemployment rate 

If there was excess supply then in the long run the wage rate would decrease as each individual would being trying to undercut one-another's wage rate to be employed therefore as the wage rate and supply of labour are directly proportional the supply of labour would also decrease. Whilst this is happening the demand for labour will begin to increase as it is inversely proportional to wage rate, this is because it will be cheaper for producers to employ new staff to allow them to produce more goods and services. Therefore the supply and demand would move towards one-another until they reach an equilibrium point where they are equal.

### Short run
In the short run there will be [[unemployment]] of Qs - Qd therefore resulting in disequilibrium and eventually market failure 

In the long run the number of workers will decrease and new equilibrium will be found
