profit maximisation is the short run or long run process by which a firm may determine the price, input and output levels that will lead to the highest possible total profit

This is achieved on a [[monopoly diagram]] where [[Economics/marginal cost]] = [[marginal revenue]]

However when a firm decides to profit maximise it creates a [[deadweight loss]] in the market as they are exploiting customers due to having [[monopolistic dominance]] 

Occurs when [[marginal revenue]] reaches 0 as if production would further increase the firm will experience [[diseconomies of scale]] and therefore lose profit
