shown on a [[Gini coefficient graph]]

The [[lorenz curve]] shows the current [[income]] distribution in the economy

## Issues using [[income]] as a measure of [[inequality]]
1. Households are difference sizes and compositions
	- Solution:
		Use weighted values to compare equivalence between households
2. [[income]] may not be the most appropriate measure of [[inequality]]
	- Solution:
		Use household expenditure rather than [[income]] as a measure of [[inequality]]

3. Housing costs constitute to a higher proportion of low [[income]] households
	- Solution:
		Exclusion of housing costs from measures of [[inequality]] show a greater degree of [[inequality]]
4. Poorer households receive [[income]] in kind in the form of benefits
	- Shows how government can use policy to influence their income distribution
		- increase benefits - Income becomes more distributed
		- decreased benefits - [[Income]] become less distributed
	- Solution:
		Factor in government provided services such as health and education
