# Common mistakes to avoid
## Time management
- long essays - make a 2 min essay plan
- Use the clock as a target - when starting a question check when the essay should be finished, keep checking the clock to see if you need to speed up

## Be ready for awkward questions
- go in expecting challenging questions
	- take a minute and work out what the content is behind the awkward question
- Don't specialise
	- always read the question to make sure you're answering the question rather than the question your hoping you got

## Use the extract
- Examiners complain that students don't use the extract enough
- Skim read the extract
	- Annotate as you go through
	- highlight AN for analysis
	- highlight EV for evaluative
	- highlight FJ for final judgement
- Use the extract to create the points and then you explain the economics behind it

## Diagrams
- very diagram heavy
	- anytime you can draw a diagram do it no matter where in the essay

## Topics coming up
- Labour market
- market structures
- market failure

## Labour market
- Learn it in a story - helps create good essays
- Building up to a competitive labour market
	- Demand curve for labour
		- Why its sloped downwards
		- What can make it shift
		- wage Elasticity
	- Supply curve for labour
		- Why its sloped downwards
		- What can make it shift
		- wage Elasticity
	- Combine and explain how competitive labour market works
- Break down assumptions of the labour market and labour market failure
- break down potential issues
	- monopsony labour market
	- trade unions
	- wage differentials
		- Understand consequences of all of them
		- understand policy intervention methods to combat them

## Market Structures
- 3 point checklist
	- Characteristics
	- Diagrams
		- Illustrate the market structure
		- shows firms efficiency
		- shows firms behaviours
	- Pros and Cons of each structure
		- Essentially the types of efficiencies that the MS is achieving
			- Statically
				- Allocative
				- Productive
				- X 
			- Dynamic
		- If a MS is achieving efficiencies then they are pros if they are not then its a con
### Cool ways to evaluate MS
- Competitive / concentrated markets
	- Level of economies of scale being achieved
		- May reach productive efficiency however many small firms may not be able to access EoS
		- So a monopoly may be able to price lower in the long run
		- Can also evaluate the lack of static efficiency within low concentration markets - oligopoly and monopoly
- With natural monopolies
	- ie competition in a natural monopoly is bad
		- Creates a lack of static efficiency
- Role of contestability - Concentrated markets
	- If markets are contestable there is no guarantee that outcomes need to be against consumer interest
		- Firms may be more competitive so acting more in consumer interest
- weighing up static vs dynamic efficiency
	- Nature of the market
		- Necessity market
			- Static efficiency matters more 
				- Drives down price and increase consumer surplus
				- high quantity of choice
				- high quality
		- Luxury markets
			- Consumers may be willing to forego some static efficiency to achieve dynamic efficiency
				- Pay a slightly higher price to help create tech advances, innovation and investment to have new goods
- Role of regulation - good for harms of a highly concentrated market
	- if highly regulated towards allocatively efficient then there will not be the harms of the market that theory says there is

### Competition policy
- gov intervention and regulation to deal with market abuse from concentrated markets
- Privatisation
- de-regulation
- nationalisation

### Market Failure
- Know all types of market failure
	- chain of analysis for each type of market failure
		- how each type of market failure results in mis-allocation of resources
- Applying policy solutions
	- Chain of analysis for how each policy
		- How the policy prevents market failure
- Revise evaluative points
	- Could there be a market solution instead
		- Can market forces fix the failure without gov intervention
			- Private profit motivated firms may fill gaps within the economy
			- Plugging this gap may then result in solving the market failure
				- Electric cars
				- plant based alternatives to meat and dairy 
	- Weigh up the risk of government failure
		- High cost of policy
		- lack of info
		- unintended consequences of intervention
	- Negative impact of heavy handed intervention on individual freedom and liberty of choice
		- Consumers may believe its not the government's responsibility to intervene
		- Consumers may believe the intervention will not be effective due to bad info
			- So consumers find a way around the policy/reject the policy
			- May protest
- often tied to context
