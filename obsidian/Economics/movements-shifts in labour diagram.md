impact on wage rate of a left shift in supply

**explain with diagram**
contraction along demand
supply of labour shifts left
[[wage rate]] increases
as the supply becomes more scarce
firms value the labour more
quantity demanded decreases

[[shift in labour demand schedule]]
[[shift in supply schedule of labour]]
the amount of change in the quantity of labour is dependent on elasticity

[[wage rate]] can only cause a movement - like price in the product market
