### Left Shift:
**Decrease in the quantity of labour supply**
bad [[working conditions]]
Lack of [[non-pecuniary benefits]]
strict [[government policies towards migrant workers]]
[[wage differential]]
relatively higher pay in other [[comparative industries]]

can be controlled by the [[transfer earnings]] of each individual
### Right shift:
**Increase in the quantity of labour supply**

Amount of labour supplied at all wage rates increases
demand for labour extends as firms take on more labour
Equilibrium [[wage rate]] decreases
Quantity of labour supplied at equilibrium increases

Good [[working conditions]]
Greater [[job satisfaction]]
loose [[government policies towards migrant workers]]
	loose policies will allow migrants workers to enter the economy easily
	ie wind-rush generation
relatively lower pay in other [[comparative industries]]
	workers move into this industry as they can make more income
