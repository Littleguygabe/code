equilibrium is reached when the wage rate is set at a value where Supply crosses demand

### Excess Supply

[[excess labour supply diagram]]
### Excess Demand
excess demand - an increase in the number of job adverts & vacancies

if there was excess demand then in the long run the wage rate would increase therefore because the wage rate and demand for labour are inversely proportional the demand for labour would decrease however at the same time the supply of labour would be increasing as the wage rate and supply of labour are directly proportional therefore both would move until they reach equilibrium where the supply curve meets the demand curve
