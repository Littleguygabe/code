The ability of workers to move seamlessly between jobs to take advantage of differences in [[wage rate]]s 

Wages reflect the relative scarcity of value of labour, higher wage rates in one industry relative to another encourages workers to change jobs.

### Restrictions
[[labour market flexibility restrictions]]

### Why is it important
- ensures labour is allocated to where it is most productive/needed
	- Where labour's [[marginal revenue product]] is highest
- Maintains an economy's [[international competitiveness]]

### Example
Labour market for both fruit picker and care workers are in equilibrium
What are the impacts on both markets if the demand for care workers increases

long run
- Wage increases for care workers
- fruit pickers are low skill so have labour market flexibility
- so they move out of the fruit picking industry as care worker wage is above their transfer price
- supply for fruit pickers then shifts left
- supply for care workers shifts right to meet the new level of demand

- Then as a result of the left shift in demand for fruit pickers there will be excess demand
- this therefore manifests itself in the form of large number of job advertisements
- However to maintain the minimum number of workers needed to be able to harvest at the current level farmers increase [[wage rate]]
- Therefore reaching new equilibrium

- Overall the [[wage rate]] for both industries increases
- Therefore if demand for care workers increases some workers will leave fruit picking whereas some will stay to take advantage of the increase in [[wage rate]]
