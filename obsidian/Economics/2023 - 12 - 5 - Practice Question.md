As of November 2023, there are currently 35000 advertised vacancies in the construction industry, with the aid of a diagram explain the current short run and long run equilibrium position of the labour market within the construction industry.

In the construction industry there is 35000 advertised vacancies within the market. This therefore indicates an excess of supply on the [[market labour supply diagram]] as Qsupply is greater than Qdemand. 

In the short run the excess supply will stick until the wage rate begins to decrease. This is because as the wage rate decreases the incentive for people to work decreases as they earn less for their time therefore the supply of labour contracts along supply whilst the demand for labour extends along the demand curve until the 2 reach at equillibrium.
