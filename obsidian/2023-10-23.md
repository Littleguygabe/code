#journal [[October '23]]
pretty much another day of medicority, went on a ride and walked the dog other than that just another bland lifeless day of being on autopilot. Doing stuff only to waste the time between waking up and going to sleep. killing time just to allow my self to sleep again that night to hopefully start a fresh tomorrow however every morning i wake up and fall to old habits not matter how much i tell myself to change and revise i just can’t. I’ve got looming deadlines, revision for exams amongst other things that just result in me going what’s the point and doing fuck-all throughout the day other than watching youtube mindlessly chasing material objects that only have percieved value rather than real genuine value - just another day living.
