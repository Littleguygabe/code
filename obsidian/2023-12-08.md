#journal [[December '23]]
Today was a fairly mediocre day, I woke up at 4 because i went to bed pretty early last night so i lay in bed till 5 then got up and did an hour and a half of coding. Then i had a little break and so ended up just not coding again. I really can't be bothered writing anything else, I've stopped pushing myself, I'm beginning to feel happy again although i shouldn't. It's been such a shit week, I'm just sat wasting my life away, although it makes me feel like complete shit tracking revision, habits and being harsh on myself still feels better than this because i feel good, but only short term, its just a waste of life, as I am at the moment there is no reason to exist nothings changing, I'm just sat watching the world go by. People say balance is important but how much balance is important, because right now my balance may feel good however it isn't, and I know it.
What would someone who is obsessed do?

**Tomorrow changes**


**Nothing changes if nothing changes**
