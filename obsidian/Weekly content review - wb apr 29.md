#### What is a tariff?
A demand side policy that implements a tax on certain imports into a country in an aim to reduce the amount of imports into the economy

#### What is the diagram for when a tariff is imposed
normal supply and demand w/ excess demand - excess is covered through imports
then the tariff is imposed and the demand contracts therefore the excess demand is reduced whilst supply extends therefore the number of imports decreases in the market

#### Who gains from a tariff?
government - through government revenue
firms - see and increase in producer surplus

#### Who loses from a tariff
Consumers - loss in consumer surplus
overall market - net welfare loss - could be argued gain depending on how gov spends increase in tax revenue

#### What is a quota?
A supply side policy that restricts the quantity of a good or service that can be imported into the market

#### What is the diagram for a quota?
Supply and demand with excess demand
then a second supply curve at the position of the current amount demanded, the left most curve represents domestic supply and the right curve represents domestic supply + imports
Then a quota is imposed and the total supply in the economy - right most curve - shifts towards the left and then the difference between the new total curve and the old total curve is the quantity of imports being reduced by the quota

#### Who gains from quotas
domestic producers - receive higher price for their goods and services
domestic market - the market expands as firms have a greater incentive to produce due to the higher prices in the market

#### Who loses from quotas?
Consumers - loss in consumer surplus
overall market - net social welfare loss
