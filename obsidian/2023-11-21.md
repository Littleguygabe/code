#journal [[November '23]]
this morning i woke up at 5 and did the dirty, then the bus was a single so it was really busy by the time that lola and ione got on, then although there was a space next to me lola didn't notice then she didn't check her phone until someone had already sat next to me. I was going to now talk about how i wanted to hold hands with - i guess i kind of am indirectly - but by talking about wanting to hold her hands re-emphasises in my head how important I've played it up to be that we need to hold hands. We don't, I'm just acting like we do need to because we have before. Then whilst i was revising for maths this morning i played clash royale for a couple of minutes. Then i realised that i was wasting time away on my phone so i deleted all the games on my phone other than stumble guys because i want something to be able to play with lola. Then once i got home, i continued thinking of ways to keep me off my phone, and i found a video that talked about how instead of deleting instagram you should just unfollow every you don't know and any companies you don't truly need to follow. So i spent the best part of an hour and as a result i cut down my following number to about half of its original value

**everyone loves you, but no-one likes you**
