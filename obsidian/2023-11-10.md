#journal [[November '23]] 
Pretty good day, I woke up at 4.30 which was good however i did the dirty rather than doin work which isn't so good however I'm not especially annoyed as it is still just the 2nd time this week and also its more important that i woke up at 4.30 because once i create a habit of waking up at 4.30 then i can continue to habit stack to create a more productive morning routine again. Other than that today was pretty normal; me and lola held hands on the bus to college and on the bus back from college the just before she got off she kissed my hand. Then I picked up my new esp32 camera for my arduino and went home. At scouts i got a message from lola asking if we could stay at hers tomorrow which is both a good and a bad thing. Its good because it means we will be able to spend more time together the next morning before she has to go to work. However its also a bad thing because it means that we are staying in a full house whereas mine would've been empty but I'm not that fussed because i can't imagine anything super major was going to happen anyway.

Then once i got home from scouts dad was looking through grandad B's laptop and he found just an empty word document that was open. Then when he pressed ctrl+z to undo he saw grandad had written 'thank you for helping me setup my laptop andrew' and so that seems like it was technically the last thing grandad ever said to dad which is a bit sad.
