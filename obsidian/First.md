Hello World!

This is my first ever obsidian file created on: 6/11/2023 as an intention to move away from notion to a more simple note taking app intended to help me more efficiently track habits as although notion is good it can be too good, at which point i begin to put too much on my page and it begins to become too much of a chore to update stuff and keep track of habits - basically it's so easy to create and customise it becomes a disadvantage to the system and therefore completely going against the reason i downloaded it in the first place - so here we are, on obsidian

I'm still learning how to use obsidian but i like that you can create a note for today at the click of a button, it will make journaling a lot easier than on notion where i have to scroll around and find the add journal page button i created, I'm going to begin by moving a load of my old journal pages over to this, because it'll be nice remembering what's happened and i don't want to lose access to that because i deleted notion.
