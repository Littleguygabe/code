#journal [[November '23]] 
Woke up at 8 and lay in bed on my phone till 9 because i wasn't in lesson today due the GCHQ talk thing. Then got up, had a shower and joined online to the GCHQ meeting and made [[GCHQ notes]] on the whole thing. Then i walked to archie's to help him build his wheel which i messed up the first time however i then fixed it and rebuilt it and tightened it all within an hour an half - which is a new personal fastest - then i got the bus home because i needed to go to A and E at some point that evening. When i got back the hair dresser was still there but this time it wasn't emily but another woman called laura and she took ages to cut our hair - 4 hours for the 4 of us - however she did do a good a job and she made sure that it was all done right whereas as emily just does everything very quickly. After that we went to A&E to try and get my ankle check out but we were going to be there waiting until 1am for me to be seen so we decided to just call it wuits and go home at 11pm and then call NHS 111 tomorrow morning and go back to A&E when the minor injuries unit was open again because by the time we had got there it was an hour before it closed and they had 4 people before us going in so we were sent back to the main waiting area where we sat for 2 hours before just going home.
