#journal [[December '23]]
Woke up at 4 and worked on my boid project for an hour, then at 5.30 me and dad went and walked the dogs and got back at more or less bob on 6.15. Then once i had got ready for college, what the fuck am i talking about, I'm running through my day like it's the intro to some fucking movie. I revised for 4.5 / 5 hours today, well i say revise it doesn't feel like ive done much because i spent 2 of those hours working on my boid project which is just fucking pointless. It's my way of procrastinating doing actual work because I've told myself that any coding is better than no coding, however it I wasn't programming that piece of shit project I have no need for then I might actually start getting towards my predicted grades which would be just amazing. I need to stop working on these little projects, I've created so many of them, none of which will ever be used other than to show people cool little things that I've programmed and how they waste hours of my time for no good reason. It's such a fucking waste of my time working on it cause it's not providing me with anything other than a theoretical justification for procrastination.

Then i stayed back and got the bus with lola which was nice because it feels like i haven't seen her that much this week since she's started coming in later. But tomorrow and friday we get the same bus in the morning which will be nice, like it was before christmas.
