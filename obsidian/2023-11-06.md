Getting used to obsidian now, third time I've written this i just can't stop changing how I'm going to organise the system but ive decided now to use double bracket links and the normal hashtag links to group and connect different files together. I'm going to create one for a habit calculator - such as the one talked about in atomic habits - to help try and create better habits for myself over time.

Today was a pretty good day all in all, woke up a bit later than normal but i didn't have college so i woke up and did the economics work that had been set then after doing that for just over an hour i took dot out. But i took her out on my bike to start getting her used to running along next to me and i decided to take the boggiest route on the moor and slid off of on of the little wooden bridge over the streams and got completely submerged in some horrible brown water. Once i got back i carried on doing some more work after having a bath then a bit after lola had got home from college we called for a couple of hours and just talked whilst i did work.
