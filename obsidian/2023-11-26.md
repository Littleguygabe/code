#journal [[November '23]]

Was up until 2.30am last night with jamboree group just messing around. Then this morning once i had got up and had breakfast then after saying bye to everyone i walked back into hebden with archie. Then once i got home i went out on my bike to put a time down the love tunnel to shut cyrus up, i put the exact same time as him, then i had a crash coming down the top of the concrete lane. However i still managed to ride all the way up the lane, didn't push any of it, then after i had got home had a quick bath and setup my laptop. Then i had work and finished at 7.15 because we ran out of dough but sophie still said she would pay me as if i had worked until 8. Then once i got home me and lola hopped in a call and then that brings me to here.
