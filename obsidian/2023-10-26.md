#journal [[October '23]]
woke up at 6.30 and really didn’t want to go on a ride but once i got my pads on i was all sorted so was out on my bike by 7 then back at mum's for 8. Then went and played badminton with olly and lola. After that we wandered around tod a bit then olly got on the bus to halifax because he had a driving lesson. Then because the bacup bus was in the station me and lola got on that to go to hers because i had a few hours to kill before work - although i ended up deciding to cancel my shift because i needed to do some coding and it meant i could stay at lola’s for longer. so stayed at lola for almost 4 hours which is always nice. Then got home had some dinner and did some coding.
