## **Both design and analysis**

data modelling

put the diagram in the design into the analysis
create ERD, [DFD diagrams](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffaculty.babson.edu%2Fdewire%2Freadings%2Fdfddiag.htm&data=05%7C02%7C100196067%40student.burnley.ac.uk%7Cf901e0253d5647a5eead08dc232051e2%7Cc5ee3f28e1254bdab46c7eca13a0238e%7C1%7C0%7C638423868922363057%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Xs5D%2FbjX5ZebG57fjivvBeXecK5A39E1lXgrQ2uk2sc%3D&reserved=0) - ERD done

## System Requirements (20 SMART Requirements)
- [x]  Secure login system
- [x]  Easy to use interface for the user - well labelled and easy to work through
- [x] Store previous simulations which are linked to each user
- [x] Admin and none administrator control separation
- [x] Be able to delete user logins from within the interface
- [x] Be able to delete simulations from within the interface
- [x]  Ability to slow down and speed up the speed of the simulation
- [x] Load the system settings from previous saves
- [x] Ability to place nodes on screen
- [x] Load nodes from the database into the simulation
- [x] The agents in the simulation move out in a natural direction
- [x] The agents find the shortest path between the nodes
- [x] Ability to run on the college computers
- [x] Be able to create user logins from within the interface
- [x] Be able to create new simulations saves from within the system
- [x] Allow a 'guest' account to be made where no simulation data is stored
- [x] Ability to view the database from within the program interface
- [x] Give the user the ability to press 'back' to move backwards to the previous window
- [x] Be able to control the number of agents used within the simulation
- [ ] The program will automatically scale so the simulation window is always the same relative size on screen
