**Evaluate, using an appropriate diagram(s), whether a maximum wage should be imposed on executive pay in the UK.**

Diagram:
left shift in supply on labour market diagram
x - quantity of labour
y - wage rate

### Intro
Brief explanation of what needs to occur for the wage max to work
- For a maximum wage to have an effect it must be set below the current market equilibrium wage
- then diagram

### Para 1
**Why shouldn't it be imposed**

#### Point
It may drive executives out of the uk labour market

#### Cause
A max wage is set below equilibrium
therefore executive wages decrease
therefore de-incentivised to work in the uk labour market
Hence they may leave

#### Consequence
Quantity of executive labour decreases
shortage of executives as demand exceeds labour
result in labour market failure

#### Diagram
max wage w/ demand excess

#### Evaluation
may depend upon the geographical flexibility of executives in the labour market

### Para 2
**Why it should be imposed**

#### Point
May result in a greater levels of low wage worker productivity

#### Cause
government recognises market failure when wages are too low
recognising when they are too high may reduce the bias that low wage workers have against executives
therefore worker motivation will increase 
so productivity of workers will increase

#### Consequence
This results in greater levels of efficiency in the production process
if this occurs for all workers then marginal revenue product per worker will increase
this allows firms to achieve greater economies of scale - high quantity of skilled labour
increases economic efficiency through an increased level of productive efficiency 
reduces costs to consumers and average price to firms
benefitting the economy

#### Diagram
PPF with outwards shift

#### Evaluate
may depend upon the elasticity of supply of labour
if workers become more productive demand may increase 
however if supply is inelastic then there will be small increase in the supply of labour
economies of scale will be restricted due to the available quantity of labour to expand

### Para 3
#### Point
A wage ceiling may ultimately result in a lack of dynamic efficiency

#### Cause
Reduced wages of executives will de-incentivise entrepreneurship 
quality and quantity of entrepreneurship may be reduced
risk taking will be discouraged 
therefore reducing the level of dynamic efficiency achieved within the market

#### Consequence
This means it may be harder to achieve further economies of scale
so efficiency is limited
so in the long-run the market could be damaged through the lack of innovation

#### Evaluate
Other levels of efficiency may be achieved - ie productive efficiency
