#journal [[November '23]]

I woke up at 5 this morning and worked on my personal statement for an hour, then I had to pack up my stuff to go to mum's. When the bus arrived - a couple minutes late - I found out it was a single and i basically got the last spare double set of seats and managed to hold onto it long enough to get to lola's stop. Then she didn't realise there was a free seat next to me so i almost ended up with some randomer sat next to me. We didn't hold hands partly because she was reading for most of the journey but also something just felt kind of 'off' between us. It's weird now because if we held hands on the bus it used to be such a massive thing in my head and now if we don't hold hands its a bit like 'oh ok then'. I know I'm just overthinking it which never does me well. Once i got into college i finished my UCAS application and then revised economics for my formal that afternoon, it went well i think i felt pretty confident answering the question but i also felt the same after my AS exam and i got a D in that. Then me and jacob made the 3.30 bus and i realised i should've hung around for the 4.33 bus and got it with lola, which I'm a bit annoyed i didn't think of doing at the time. Then i got home and waited for about half an hour before i went and picked up the pizzas for tea, I ended up walking across hebden as it was chucking it down but it resulted in a nice enough photo so could be worse. Then after pizza I've just done bits and bobs of revision until now
