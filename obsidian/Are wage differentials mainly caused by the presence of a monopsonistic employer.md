### Intro
definition of:
- monopsonistic employer - a sole employer of labour within the labour market
- wage differentials - the difference in wages of workers with different skills in the same industry or comparable skills in different industries or localities

### Para 1
Yes

**Point**
A monopsonistic employer will aim to profit maximise which can result in wage differentials in the labour market between less competitive and competitive markets

**Cause**
sole employer of labour
so to attract more labour they must increase wage
however this means increasing wage for all workers
so each worker has an associated marginal cost from increasing the wage 
so we assume a profit maximising firm will employ where MC = MR
in less competitive markets labour is more abundant
so to reach MC = MR the wage rate doesn't need to be as high as more labour is available

**Consequence**
workers in less competitive markets will be paid a lower wage
resulting in wage differentials between competitive and un-competitive markets

### Para 2
No

**Point**
Labour supply restrictions such as immobility can be a leading factor in creating wage differentials

**Cause**
Labour is often occupationally immobile
As in reality all labour does not have homogenous qualifications and skills
this creates barriers to entry as a mechanic cannot become a nurse to take advantage of reduced wage differentials as the training time to become a medical professional is very long
therefore supply of labour tends to being inelastic
therefore in industries with high barriers to entry will have greater wages as a result of the high cost of entry for labour
whereas mechanics have lower barriers to entry resulting in a lower wage being paid

**Consequence**
this means that labour in high skill industries will have higher wages
as in reality not all labour has the same skill set/qualifications
therefore creating wage differentials

**Diagram**
Labour supply and demand for industry with an inelastic curve and elastic curve to demonstrate the difference between mechanics and nurses

**Evaluate**
However this does not account for wage differentials within an industry where workers have 'similar skill sets which may show that monopsonies are the main reason for wage discrimination

### Para 3
No
**Point**
in a perfect market - where there are no monopsonies - wage differentials still occur as firms employ according to the MRP of an individual
