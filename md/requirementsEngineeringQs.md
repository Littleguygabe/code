1. What are the 4 core processes in the software engineering cycle
specification, development, validation, evolution

2. Why is it singificantly more expensive to fix errors later in the software life cycle compared to the fixing them in the requirements stage
If an error is identified in the later stages of the dev cycle it can be up to 200x more costly to fix than in the requirements stage, this is because by the time the error is found (if found in the accpetance testing stage for example) the documentation, code and tests have all already been produced and implemented therefore to change one aspect of the system the cycle would almost need to start again as the requirements would have to be re-evaluated and then re-programmed and then new tests need to be implemented and ran.

However if this is handled within the requirements stage then nothing has been produced yet so there is nothing that has to be back tracked on therefore no resources are wasted re-making features that have already gone through the full development life-cycle therfore showing how it is cheaper

3. what is the primary goal of requirements engineering
to methodically and logically establish all the requirements for the system for the given client

4. List the 4 main stages of the requirements engineering process
- Feasability study - ensuring that what the client is asking for is actually feasable
- Requirements elicitation - establishing the requirements that will be needed for the system
- Requirements specification - Specifying how each requirement is going to be met
- Requirements validation - validating that the requirements are correct

5. What is requirements elicitation and why is it considered challenging
Requirements elicitation is deducing exactly what the requirements for the system are based on the info the client has given you and the research you have performed through out the requirements gathering process. It is considered challening because there are many opportunities for assumptions about the system to be made which can result in inaccurate requirements for the system so it may get rejected when the software gets to the acceptance testing stage.

6. In stakeholder analysis what are the three common classifications of stakeholders
- primary stake holders, those who directly interact with the system
- secondary stake holders, those who have some interaction with the system, ie system admins
- tertiary stake holders, those who are only effected by the system indirectly, ie regulation bodies
