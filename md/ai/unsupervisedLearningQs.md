1. Name 2 real world applications of un-supervised learning
- Marketing/Retail Trends (beer & nappies)
- Fraud detection

2. What is the main goal of clustering in unsupervised learning

The main goal is to categorise ub-labelled data so that patterns can be analysed and exploited through a range of methods. This places the data into distinct data groups that can then show correlations between the input factors

3. Describe the role of centroids in the k-means clustering algorithm

Clusteroids represent the center of a cluster group within k-means clustering. Then the position of the centeroids are used to establish which cluster a given point should be placed into then once all the points have been classified the centeroids are moved the the average position of all of the datapoints within the centeroids assocaited group. Then the process of clustering begins again and this loop goes on for a given number of iterations. In summary centeroids represent the center of a given cluster

4. in k-means clustering what metric is typically used to assign data points to the nearest centroid

the distance to the nearest centroid - by assigning a point to the nearest centroid

5. what type of data is required for training an unsupervised learning model

Quantitative data that is high quality and cleaned of any null/NaN values

6. Explain the purpose of association rules for in unsupervised learning

the purpose of them is to try and find correlation between any nuumber of variables >1

7. Why is it important to distinguish between correlation and causation when interpreting the results of association rule mining

it is important to distinguish because correlation simply shows a relationship between 2 products whereas causation displays a stronger relationship that one aspect results in another aspect, so they they are 2 seperate concepts that imply different ideas.

8. besides k-means name one other algorithm that is used for association rules



9. What is a major challenge in evaluating the accuracy of unsupervised learning models compared to supervised learning models

unsupervised models don't have a pre-defined metric that they can be evaluated agaist as they are discovering new relationships or patterns so although we may be able to look at the data and see a rough relationship between the given aspects it can be hard to confidently identify until the relationship is put into practice
