1. What is the primary objective of release testing
Release testing is making sure that the system has met all the specifications that were defined after looking at the requirements for the system. This is the last phase of testing done before the program is passed onto the client for acceptance testing

2. How does release testing differ from integration testing
Release testing is about looking at a program as a whole to make sure that all aspects of the specification have been met, this type of testing is the last level of testing done before the program is put infront of the client to be have acceptance testing performed. However integration testing on the other hand is aimed at testing small sections of the program in isolation - typically a few functions/classes - that communicate with one another to test that the classes can correctly communicate with one another, this is the first level of testing where multiple sections of the program are being ran together however it is not the whole program - like in release testing.

4. Name and briefly describe three strategies for release testing
- performance driven testing, this is where the system is essentially stress tested to make sure that it can perform up to a certain standard whilst in certain conditions. Ie test the system as a <2s load time with 1000 concurrent users 90% of the time
- high-level specification driven testing, this is testing where we use the high level interface of the finished program to test that the system meets the specification in every day use not just when we are performing targetted tests through code
- scenario driven tests, this is when we take a scenario created during the requirements gathering phase and then derive tests based on the scenario to try and simulate normal use on the system to make sure it still runs well for a range of scenarios and users

5. Who typically performs acceptance testing
Usually the software engineering company will take the system to the client to setup the acceptance tests so the client can see the software implemented on their system using their data and then the testing is performed by the client or the client represtative.

6. What is the main goal of acceptance testing from the clients perspective
From the client's perspective acceptance testing is there to ensure that the software that has been produced matches the requirements they set at the start of the development process to a suitable degree - there may be some errors - and then once testing is complete and they have seen how the system performs it is then up to them to decide whether the system was adequate and whether to accept or reject it. if they do reject it it is then a matter of deciding what would make it acceptable from where it currently is
