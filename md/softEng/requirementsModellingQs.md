1. Explain the Primary purpose of creating requirements models in software engineering
Creating requirements models allows us to properly visualise and understand exactly what the requirements are that the clients wants for the system, when just talking about the requirements this can result in ambiguity in what we mean in certain situations and therefore can ultimately result in the final product being incorrect however we will not know until the acceptance testing phase is reached at which point the cost to fix any issues will be incredibly high. 

Modelling the requirements can also help us identify the specifications that will be needed to achieve a given requirement which can streamline the development process, help us build better documentation and improve the quality of the low level models that are provided to the programmers. So ultiamtely modelling requirements helps improve translate exactly what the client needs out of the system across all aspects of the development cycle

2. What is they key difference between a requirements use case diagram and a specifications use case diagram
A requirements use case diagram models the behaviours that the system needs to have and what each stakeholder should be able to do, whereas a specifications use case diagram is used to show how each of these requirements will be achieved/designed and implemented.

Furthermore the requirements diagram is typically 'client facing' therefore may not include as much technical information and take on a high-level appearance so that it can be easily understood by all parties, whereas a specification diagram will typically be more technical and a lower level because they can then be used by developers to understand how certain aspects of the program should work

3. Describe what a context diagram is primarily used to illustrate in requirements modelling
A context diagram is aimed to show how the new system will implement into other systems within the external environment the new system is being implemented into. 

It can also be used to understand where the boundaries of the system need to be as we can see pre-existing systems that are going to be used and therefore the new system won't need to include their functionality as it is already created and accessable, therefore we can see exactly where the limits of the functionality of the system need to be.

4. How does hierarchical task analysis differ from activity diagrams in terms of what they are best suited to model
Hierarchical task analysis shows how requirements/components of the system will be decomposed into subsections wholely and then invesely it can also allow the developer to see which parts of the system will be aggregated together to achieve certain goals within the system, this creates a sort of roadmap that can be easily followed to see how the system's different areas integrate with one-another to create a fully cohesive system.

An activity diagram on the other hand breaks down exactly the processes which will be carried out for a user wanting to do a particular action, this only shows the flow of the task whereas the hierarchical task analysis shows the structure of the program.

5. Name 5 types of UML diagrams
Activity diagram
use case diagram
class diagram
sequence diagram 
state diagram

6. what do diamonds represent in an activity diagram
decisions made within the activity 

7. What type of information flow are sequence diagrams particularly good at representing
The complex flow of information/data between process to perform a single action

8. When might a class diagram be created during the requirements phase, even though it is often considered a part of specifications
One reason a class diagram might be used in the requirements phase is to clarify and remove ambiguity in the core foundations of the system. Typically the clients will be coming from a non-technical background so being able to create a class diagram that can remove ambiguity from the structure that may be needed from the system can be useful in understanding the exact requirements. 

Furthermore it can help to identify relationships and by doing this at the requirements phase we can ensure that these relationships do infact exist, this is easiest done through a visual representation as it then abstracts it from having to need technical knowledge so may be beneficial for the client aswell.

9. What is the main purpose of a state diagram
A state diagram is used to be able to view the different states that a system may be in at at any given moment and then how they system should be able to transition from state to state. This can help the developers understand the flow of the system at a more techincal level as it also provides them with the context for which the system should change from one state to another.

10. Beyond just being a story, what structured elements should a scenario include according to the source
It should include the context for the situation, ie the environment in which the system is currently in, and then also it should include atleast 1 stake holder and how they are aiming to use the system in its current state for a given goal.
